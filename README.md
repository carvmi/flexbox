## Technologies 
- HTML
- CSS

## What I have learned
- Reset box model by adding a * or html rule selector to the CSS file with the box-sizing property set to border-box
- Put div elements of class gallery inline when using display property set to flex 
- Adjust flex with properties like flex-direction and flex-wrap (other examples include flex-basis, flex-flow, flex-grow and flex-shrink)
- Flex-basis acts similar with width property
